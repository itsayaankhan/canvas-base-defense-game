The rights to this game go to Chris Courses.

I was simply using his course for learning purposes, as well as modifying and tweaking a parts of the code.

You can check out his other courses and material on his website: https://chriscourses.com/ 
(by the way, his resources on HTML 5 canvas, JS, CSS, and game development are amazing and would recommend for any begineer, intermediate, and advanced programmers)
